# LoRaWan_MultiSensor

This sketch allows you to use a number of sensors.
All you have to do is to set the number to a 1 beside the sensor you would like to use.
You can choose more than one sensor.

Selecting AUTO_SCAN the Firmware will try to identify the connected I2C Sensor by its address.
AUTO_SCAN takes its time, it is not very battery friendly. 
Please select the sensor for saving battery power, for maximum flexibility choose AUTO_SCAN.

    #define AUTO_SCAN  1
    #define BME_680    0 
    #define BME_280    0
    #define CCS_811    0
    #define BMP_180    0 
    #define HDC_1080   0
    #define BH_1750    0
    #define SHT_2X     0
    #define ADS_1015   0
    #define One_Wire   0 // sometime the device hangs

and set your keys:

    const char myDevEui[] = { 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00 };
    const char myAppEui[] = { 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00 };
    const char myAppKey[] = { 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00 };

and set the DutyCycle in ms:

    uint32_t APP_TX_DUTYCYCLE = 900000;

If you would like to add a TCA9548A 8port I2C switch to the I2C bus:
    
    #define ModularNode 1

if not 

    #define ModularNode 0

TTN Decoder:

  The ttn-decode.js file automaticaly decodes all known sensor types.

Known Failures:

- One_Wire: no sensors found
